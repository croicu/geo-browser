# CLAUDE.md — geo-browser

## Project

`geo-browser` is a static, browser-based geographic renderer and UI shell.

It renders catalog-driven geographic experiences from static JSON/GeoJSON assets and can also run in a future design mode hosted by `geo-builder` through a WebView bridge.

## Current Product Shape

The app has two UI modes:

- **Summary**: discovery/world overview using Leaflet, displaying one bubble/marker per learned area.
- **Detail**: immersive selected-area view using Leaflet, rendering layers such as points and heatmaps.

Core pipeline:

```text
HEAD
  → Catalog
    → AreaSummary
      → AreaDetail
        → Layer metadata
          → GeoLayer.load()
            → GeoJSON
              → LayerView
                → Leaflet primitives / leaflet.heat
```

## Hard Architecture Rules

- `protocols.ts` contains serializable data contracts only.
- `contracts.ts` contains behavioral/runtime interfaces only.
- `runtime/Context` is the external-world boundary.
- `catalog/` owns domain loading/runtime wrappers.
- `state/` owns serializable UI/application state.
- `view/` owns DOM, Leaflet rendering, widgets, and layer views.
- `app/Controller` owns orchestration, mode transitions, durable state mutation, and view switching.
- Views and widgets emit intent only.
- Controller owns behavior.
- Unit tests must not import Leaflet or hit the network.
- Only `view/detail/leafletFactories.ts` imports Leaflet and Leaflet plugins.

## Naming Rules

Files are camelCase:

```text
summaryView.ts
detailView.ts
summaryViewState.ts
detailViewState.ts
leafletFactories.ts
```

Classes and interfaces are PascalCase:

```ts
SummaryView
DetailView
SummaryViewState
DetailViewState
GeoCatalog
GeoArea
GeoLayer
```

Major architectural classes use single-word names inside folders where possible:

```text
runtime/Context
catalog/Catalog
catalog/Area
catalog/Layer
app/Controller
```

Folder provides namespace. Class uses the simplest meaningful name.

## Vocabulary

Use these terms consistently:

```text
Summary = discovery/world overview mode
Detail  = selected-area immersive mode
Area    = domain concept
Bubble  = summary UI widget concept
Layer   = protocol/data concept
GeoLayer = runtime wrapper/cache
```

Do not reintroduce `intro` vocabulary unless explicitly requested. The project settled on `summary/detail`.

## TypeScript Style

The project favors explicit readable TypeScript.

Avoid:

- clever terse one-liners
- heavy optional chaining when explicit branches are clearer
- anonymous inline object fakes in tests
- large inline lambdas
- module mocks when DI works

Prefer:

- explicit private fields
- explicit constructor assignment
- small named stub/fake classes
- dependency injection through options objects
- methods over large lambdas
- methods over free functions when behavior belongs semantically to a class

Because `erasableSyntaxOnly` is enabled, do not use constructor parameter properties:

```ts
// Bad
constructor(private readonly sink: TelemetrySink) {}

// Good
private readonly _sink: TelemetrySink;

constructor(sink: TelemetrySink) {
    this._sink = sink;
}
```

Project readability rule:

```text
If a lambda is more than one logical statement, promote it to a named method.
```

## Testing Rules

Use Vitest.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:run": "vitest run"
  }
}
```

Tests live under:

```text
tests/unit/
tests/stubs/
tests/fakes/
```

Terminology:

- `stub`: tiny DI contract implementation.
- `fake`: lightweight subsystem simulation.

Rules:

- Unit tests run offline.
- Do not import Leaflet in unit tests.
- Stub our contracts, not third-party libraries.
- Use DI instead of module mocks.
- Reset global singletons between tests.
- Prefer behavior/wiring assertions over pixel-perfect layout assertions.

## Current Important Branch Decisions

### Runtime Context

`Context` is a singleton under `src/runtime/context.ts`.

It owns environment and external services:

```ts
export type Mode = "browse" | "design";

export class Context {
    readonly mode: Mode;
    readonly debug: boolean;
    readonly data: GeoDataService;
    readonly storage: StorageService;
    readonly logger: Logger;
    readonly host: HostService;
}
```

Rules:

- `?design=<value>` means design mode.
- otherwise browse mode.
- `?debug=<value>` enables debug.
- empty values are ignored.
- `Context.resetForTest()` exists for tests.

Context is external-world boundary, not application state. Do not put selected area, visible layers, loaded catalog, or current view into Context.

### Data Source / Design Mode

Future design mode integrates with `geo-builder`:

```text
geo-browser TypeScript UI
  ↕ HostApi / window.geoHost
geo-builder Python host
  ↕ provider APIs, storage, artifact generation
```

Repos stay separate:

- `geo-browser`: rendering/client UI.
- `geo-builder`: Python host, data pipeline, project persistence, artifact generation.

### Leaflet Summary View

Summary now uses Leaflet too. The old static `world.svg` approach was replaced.

Current model:

```text
SummaryView
  owns Leaflet map
  owns BubbleWidget[]

DetailView
  owns Leaflet map
  owns widgets
  owns LayerView map
```

Summary = discovery mode, not non-Leaflet mode.

### Heatmaps

`heatmap` layers use `leaflet.heat` through `leafletFactories.ts` only.

Input remains GeoJSON Point features:

```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "properties": { "weight": 1.0 },
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [14.2681, 40.8518]
  }
}
```

GeoJSON coordinates are `[longitude, latitude]`.
Leaflet coordinates are `[latitude, longitude]`.

Default event weight is `1.0`; heatmap density accumulation is handled by the renderer/plugin.

## Next Likely Work

Good next branches:

1. Map click logging in DetailView: click map → log GPS coordinates.
2. Viewport synchronization: Leaflet move/zoom → update view state → persist/restore.
3. Design-mode data source abstraction.

Keep branches narrow.
